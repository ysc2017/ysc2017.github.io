Monash Business School is a dynamic and progressive academy delivering the highest quality teaching, learning, scholarship and research. We are among the 1% of business schools in the world to have achieved the elite 'triple crown' of accreditation by the three major global business school accreditation bodies – [AACSB](http://www.aacsb.edu/), [EQUIS](https://www.efmd.org/accreditation-main/equis) and [AMBA](http://www.aacsb.edu/) – and the only Group of Eight Australian university to have done so.

Monash Business School’s Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics is one of the few departments in the world that is dedicated to econometrics and business statistics. It is also the only department in Australia with dedicated honours and postgraduate programs in the area.

Our areas of research strength include econometric theory and methods, applied econometrics, statistics, time series analysis, forecasting, data visualisation and analytics. As a testament to the quality of our research, Monash was given the highest possible rank (“well above world standard”) in the discipline of econometrics in the 2012 and 2015 “Excellence in Research for Australia” assessments.
